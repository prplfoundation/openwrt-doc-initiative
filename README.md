#OpenWrt Wiki Issue Tracker
This repository is used solely for managing the issues tracker for the OpenWrt wiki. Learn how to file an issue or fix it below.

##This isn't the place to file general OpenWrt bugs
We want you to file general OpenWrt bugs but this isn't the place to do it. Please visit https://dev.openwrt.org/newticket to file your OpenWrt bug.

Documenting OpenWrt is an important but often neglected task. Like in all open source projects, documentation is extremely valuable but it's often difficult for core developers to find the time to do so. prplwrt and prpl Foundation are participating in an effort to improve OpenWrt documentation to provide tutorials, guides and reference information for OpenWrt. Our goal is to improve the quality and breadth of the documentation in a community-managed, welcoming and accessible fashion.

**Always remember: you can ask for help if you're confused either on an issue or [on the OpenWrt forum](https://forum.openwrt.org/viewforum.php?id=17)**

#How to file an issue

1. First, it's possible your issue has already been reported. To check, visit the [issues page](https://github.com/prplfoundation/openwrt-doc-initiative/issues) and search for your issue. If it's there and you'd like to help with the issue, look at How to fix an issue below. 

2. If you issue hasn't been reported, you should [create a new issue](https://github.com/prplfoundation/openwrt-doc-initiative/issues/new).

3. Write a descriptive title. Someone potentially interested who's searching or skimming the list of issues would notice it right away based on the title.

4. Write a clear description. Your description should clearly explain the problem you're seeing. Please be specific enough that completion can be measured; something general like "The documention isn't easy for new user." is good to discuss but it's not specific enough to measure completion. If you have ideas on changes to make, make sure to explain them. It's possible yourself and others could jointly decide that the changes you propose aren't appropriate but at least everyone has a starting point to work from. Don't hesitate to include pictures, diagrams, videos, or something else if they'd help you explain the problem or your proposed solution. **Also, make sure include the URLs of the pages you're referring to in your issue description.**

5. Press Submit New Issue. You've created your first issue! If you want to help fix the issue (which we'd love), look at How to fix an issue below.

#How to find an issue to work on

If you're new to documenting OpenWrt and want something straightforward to get into, look for issues with the [bite-sized label](https://github.com/prplfoundation/openwrt-doc-initiative/labels/bite-sized). Bite-sized issues are ones which are designed to be straight forward to work on, particularly for people new to documenting OpenWrt.

If you want to look at all the issues, just visit the [issues page](https://github.com/prplfoundation/openwrt-doc-initiative/issues) and look through the list or issues or use the search to find an issue.

#How to fix an issue

Like most open source documentation projects, the OpenWrt wiki is a collaborative effort. The best solutions for the broadest number of users are created when community members discuss the issues. Significant changes to the wiki should be filed as an issue and discussed. Fixing an issue should generally follow this process:

1. Look at the comments for the issue you're going to work on. Are people discussing the issue currently? If they are, feel free to jump in. Don't hesitate to share your thoughts, respectfully if possible, and offer your help. If no one has commented, please comment and express your interest! If you have particular ideas on implementation, do that too.

2. At some point, you'll likely move to implementing a change. In some cases, everyone agrees to move forward and in other cases you'll be the only one involved. Both situations are okay! As you work, update the issue with what changes you've made so others can follow your progress. Even if others didn't comment, they may still be interested.

3. Once everyone involved feels the changes are completed, the issue should be closed. If someone realizes there are additional changes which need to be made, it's okay to reopen the issue later.

#Want to discuss ideas that aren't directly related to an issue?
Not every discussion related to working on the wiki is appropriate for issues. If you want to discuss how this effort is organized, have announcements or just general wiki related discussion, you should do this on [the OpenWrt forum](https://forum.openwrt.org/viewforum.php?id=17).
